details company tata consultancy services description project description data warehouse division has multiple products for injecting storing analysing and presenting data the data lake program is started to provide multitalent secure data hub to store applications data on hadoop platform with strong data governance lineage auditing and monitoring capabilities the object of the project is to provide necessary engineering support to analytics and application teams so that they can focus on the business logic development in this project the major task is to set up the hadoop cluster and govern all the activities which are required for the smooth functioning of various hadoop ecosystems as the day and day data increasing so to provide stability to the ecosystem and smooth working of it developing and automating the various requirement specific utilities responsibility developed proactive health check utility for data lake the utility proactively checks the smooth functioning of all hadoop components on the cluster and sends the result to email in html format the utility is being used for daily health checks as well as after upgrades getting the data in different formats and processing the data in hadoop ecosystem after filtering the data using the appropriate techniques developed data pipeline utility to ingest data from rdbms database to hive external tables using sqoop commands the utility also offers the data quality check like row count validation developed and automated various cluster health check usage capacity related reports using unix shell scripting optimization of hive queries in order to increase the performance and minimize the hadoop resource utilizations creating flume agents to process the data to hadoop ecosystem side performed benchmark testing on the hive queries and impala queries involved in setting up the cluster and its components like edge node and ha implementation of the services hive server impala and hdfs filtering the required data from available data using different technologies like pig regex serde etc dataiku benchmark testing on top of impala and hive in compare to greenplum database moving the data from

started to provide multitalent secure data hub to store applications data on hadoop platform with strong data governance lineage auditing and monitoring capabilities the object of the project is to provide necessary engineering support to analytics and application teams so that they can focus on the business logic development in this project the major task is to set up the hadoop cluster and govern all the activities which are required for the smooth functioning of various hadoop ecosystems as the day and day data increasing so to provide stability to the ecosystem and smooth working of it developing and automating the various requirement specific utilities responsibility developed proactive health check utility for data lake the utility proactively checks the smooth functioning of all hadoop components on the cluster and sends the result to email in html format the utility is being used for daily health checks as well as after upgrades getting the data in different formats and processing the data in hadoop ecosystem after filtering the data using the appropriate techniques developed data pipeline utility to ingest data from rdbms database to hive external tables using sqoop commands the utility also offers the data quality check like row count validation developed and automated various cluster health check usage capacity related reports using unix shell scripting

team size brief wipros neural intelligence platform harnesses the power of automation and artificial intelligence technologiesnatural language processing nlp cognitive machine learning and analytics the platform comprises three layers a data engagement platform that can easily access and manage multiple structured and unstructured data sources an intent assessment and reasoning engine that includes sentiment and predictive analytics and a deep machine learning engine that can sense act and learn over time the project entailed automating responses to user queries at the earliest the monster bot using the power of deep machine learning nlp to handle such queries user can see the how their queries can be answered quickly like alll activities can be eliminated entity extractor this involves text extraction and nlp for fetching out important information from the text like dates names places contact numbers etc this involves regex bluemix nlu apis and machine learning using tensor flow for further learning of new entities classifier this involves the classifications of classes training of dataset and predicting the output using the sklearn classifier mnb svm sgd as classifier and sgd for the optimization to map the user queries with the best suited response and make the system efficient ner a deep learning ner model is trained to extract the entities from the text entities like roles skills organizations can be extracted from raw text rnnlstm bidirectional model is trained for extracting such entities using keras tensorflow framework other projects title diabetes

of birthgenderyyyymmdd f company wipro description developing programs in python company wipro description title wipro neural intelligence platform team size brief wipros neural intelligence platform harnesses the power of automation and artificial intelligence technologiesnatural language processing nlp cognitive machine learning and analytics the platform comprises three layers a data engagement platform that can easily access and manage multiple structured and unstructured data sources an intent assessment and reasoning engine that includes sentiment and predictive analytics and a deep machine learning engine that can sense act and learn over time the project entailed automating responses to user queries at the earliest the monster bot using the power of deep machine learning nlp to handle such queries user can see the how their queries can be answered quickly like alll activities can be eliminated entity extractor this involves text extraction and nlp for fetching out important information from the text like dates names places contact numbers etc this involves regex bluemix nlu apis and machine learning using tensor flow for further learning of new entities classifier this involves the classifications of classes training of dataset and predicting the output using the sklearn classifier mnb svm sgd as classifier and sgd for the optimization to map the user queries with the best suited response and make the system efficient ner a deep learning ner model is trained to extract the entities from the text entities like roles skills organizations can be extracted from raw text rnnlstm bidirectional model is trained for extracting such entities using keras tensorflow framework company wipro technologies description an it professional with knowledge and experience of
